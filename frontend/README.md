# Selective Practice Quiz

This frontend application provides a way to randomly select and practice questions from a personalized question bank. The question bank is specifically populated with questions that were previously answered incorrectly in Scholarly trial tests, allowing for focused review and improvement.

## Features

*   Fetches a random question from your Supabase database.
*   Displays the question and its options.
*   (Future potential: Allow answering and feedback)

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to help users reinforce their learning by revisiting questions they found challenging in past Scholarly trial tests. By selectively practicing these questions, users can better understand their mistakes and solidify their knowledge in those areas.
